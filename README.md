**Hospital Management System**
Description:

The Hospital Management System is a Java-based project designed to simplify and automate the management of patients, doctors, staff, appointments, and billing in a hospital environment. This project leverages core concepts of data structures and algorithms to ensure efficient functionality while maintaining scalability and robustness.

The system incorporates sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, file handling, and exception handling to provide a comprehensive solution for hospital management tasks.
